Your token goes in here

Your token is the file containing the information that confirms you're the owner of the Gmail account that you're using.

If there is no token in this folder, then the Gmail API will open up your default web browser and send you to an authorization page which allows you to log in. After successfully logging in and enabling this project (after a couple of warnings that the project isn't verified), a token will be created in this folder.

So if you ever want to change the Gmail account which IAMME uses, just delete your token and re-enable IAMME as another logged-in Google user.
